This userscript adds multiple improvements to the xplay.gg store and auction pages, like...
* ...a button to open the skin on the Steam community market
* ...a button to load the skin's community market price
* ...a ratio of the xcoin price to your currency set in Steam
* ...highlighting StatTrak™ and Souvenir items in color

## Installation
### Prerequisites
To be able to use this userscript, you need the Tampermonkey userscript manager extension for your browser.  
I only test this extension with Tampermonkey, so don't expect it to work on other userscript managers.  

Download Tampermonkey here: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) - [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd) - [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)

### Quick Install


Once you have installed Tampermonkey, [click here](https://github.com/Tr345ure/xplay-store-enhance/raw/main/xplay-store-enhance.user.js) to quick install the userscript.  
If the quick install method is not working for you, please proceed to the manual install section.

### Manual Install

Once you have installed Tampermonkey, follow these steps to add the script:
1. Copy the code from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tr345ure/xplay-store-enhance/main/script.js) 
2. Click the Tampermonkey extension icon
3. Click `➕ Create new userscript`
4. Remove the all of the prefilled code and paste the copied code
5. Click `File` > `Save` or hit `CTRL+S`

You can then close the extension page.

## Automatic updates
By default, Tampermonkey automatically queries for script updates daily and prompt you to install them if any are available. If you want to manually check for updates, click the time or date that appears in the `Last updated` column of the Tampermonkey userscript overview.
