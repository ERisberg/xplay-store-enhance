#  XPLAY.GG Store Enhance
## Installation
### Quick Install
If you already have Tampermonkey installed, [**click here**](https://github.com/Tr345ure/xplay-store-enhance/raw/main/xplay-store-enhance.user.js) to quick install the userscript. If you do not have Tampermonkey installed or the quick install is not working for you, please proceed to the regular install section.
### Regular Install
To be able to use this userscript, you need the Tampermonkey userscript manager extension for your browser.

**Tampermonkey Download**  
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) - [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd) - [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)

I only test this extension with Tampermonkey, so don't expect it to work on other userscript managers.

Once you have installed Tampermonkey in your browser, follow these steps to add the script:
1. Copy the code from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tr345ure/xplay-store-enhance/main/script.js) 
2. Click the Tampermonkey extension icon
3. Click `âž• Create new userscript`
4. Remove the prefilled code and paste the copied code
5. Click `File` > `Save` or hit `CTRL+S`

You can then close the extension page.

If you have questions regarding the operation of Tampermonkey, please refer to the [Tampermonkey documentation](https://www.tampermonkey.net/documentation.php?locale=en).

## Automatic updates
Tampermonkey should automatically install updates for the script. If you want to manually check for updates, click the time or date that appears in the `Last updated` column of the userscript overview.
